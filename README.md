# An Analysis of Green Energy Stocks for 2017 & 2018
## Overview of Project
Explore green energy stock performance through analyzing financial data using VBA
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve determine which green energy stocks his parents should invest in by calculating each stock's total daily volume and return for the years of 2017 and 2018. By using VBA, Steve will be able to analyze these green energy stocks with just a click of a button!
## Results
### Stock Performace Between 2017 & 2018
The green energy stocks during the year of 2017 overall had a significantly higher percentage return comapred to the year of 2018. For example, the only ticker that was negative for percentage return in 2017 was ticker, TERP. In 2018, the results revealed that there were only two tickers out of the list that had a positive percentage return. Also, the total daily volume for most of the stocks in 2017 seemed to be higher compared to 2018, for the exception of a few tickers.
### Execution Times 
As for the execution times, the refractored script worked significantly faster than the original script. The refractored script for 2017 and 2018 ran at about 0.1523 seconds and 0.1875 seconds compared to the orignal script that only ran at about 0.60 seconds.

## Summary
###### 1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refractoring code? 
One of the main advantages of refractoring code is that by refractoring the code, you are able to create a better quality code. Better quality, in this sense, means creating a more efficent, maintainable, and extendable code that is easier for others to read and to understand. Other advantages include a speedier performance rate and saving costs! One of the biggest disadvantages of refractoring code is that it becomes incredibly time consuming as the coder has no idea how long refractoring might take.
###### 2. How do these pros and cons apply to refractoring the original VBA script?
From the results, we can clearly see that the refractored code has a much speedier performace rate than the original VBA script. We can also draw attention to the fact that the refractored code is much more easier to read and understand! However, the cons of refractoring apply to me as well. It took me a much longer time to refractor the code and debug the errors, sometimes leading me into situations where I was unsure of what step to take next.
